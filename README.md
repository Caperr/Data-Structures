# Data-Structures 
Small programs implementing various data structures, in python 3 for the moment but may expand.

Circular Queue  
A simple implementation following pseudocode I read whilst revising A' level computer science before the start of my degree.
Unfortunately, certain aspects of the queue (e.g size) are hard-coded. Future Jasper, please do fix this.  
Includes a rudimentary interface to print the queue's state on the commandline.
  
Binary Tree  
A recursive binary tree implementation whipped up during the introductory python lectures in the first year of my degree.
Thankfully, I was already knowledgable with python, so I wrote this for fun whilst the lectures went through if statements....  
You'll notice comments that I have left challenging my coursemates to make a method to print out the tree.  
  
Hash Table  
A simple hashing algorithm that uses string folding to generate keys, and linear probing to handle collisions.  
This algorithm is generalised, but an example case is provided demonstrating deterministic hashing and collisions handling.  
  
  
  
I'd recommend checking my misc. programs repository for some interesting programs, such as a hacking sim, a number base converter, and a magic tree solver.
